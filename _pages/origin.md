## Economic Encouragement, Creativity, & Development

Replica was created with 1 goal in mind, and that's to stimulate awareness regarding economic learning. Even with the introduction to Bitcoin and the like, the understanding of economics seems to limit the progressive rate of adoption worldwide. Thanks to Bitcoin Cash's 'Simple Ledger Protocol', creating cryptocurrency couldn't be any easier, however, usage is still misunderstood. Our objective is to effectively educate everyone on how to create value and maintain it long term. Without comprehending token supply, cryptoexchanges, and business integration, then the cycle of failure will continue. Don't continue to be just another person or business in crypto, become the standard with Replica economics.
